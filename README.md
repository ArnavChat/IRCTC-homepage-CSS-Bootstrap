# IRCTC-homepage-CSS-Bootstrap
(19/7/2023) I have made the homepage of IRCTC website using only CSS and Bootstrap
As a recruitment task from VITrendz, I was assigned the task of cloning the IRCTC website within a time limit of 2 days.
In these three days, I learned how to work with Bootstrap and also polished my HTML and CSS skills.
This is the final product. Given more time, after applying JS, this website can be upgraded.
